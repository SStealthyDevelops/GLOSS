# What is GLOSS?

Current site: https://sites.google.com/percygrainger.org/gloss/home 

GLOSS is the Grainger Library of Sampled Sound, a collection of sounds recorded by Percy Grainger. The collection 
consists of sounds recorded from the house and studio of Percy Grainger, in White Plains, New York. 


# Project Summary

This project aims to replace the current website, hosted on Google Sites. Beyond that, the goal is to make the 
entire GLOSS collection highly accessible and interactive. Users should be able to interact with and manipulate the 
sounds from the collection, along with other open-source sounds, to create interesting results. Eventually, it will 
be developed towards an open-source digital audio workstation (DAW). 


# Project Timeline

The goal is to have a demo with (1) an exciting homepage and (2) interactive ways to use the sounds by the end of 
the academic semester (mid-December, 2025).

Main tasks:

**Build a homepage**
  - [ ] Explanation of GLOSS
  - [ ] Relevance
  - [ ] Link currently available videos and other options

**Interactive way to use sounds**
  - [ ] Be able to click buttons and play any sound (not very interactive yet)
  - [ ] Make a pretty page to play sounds
  - [ ] (Advanced) Build some way to pitch-shift the non-instrumental sounds
  - [ ] (Advanced) Build a way to layer and record sounds -- create music i.e. DAW
